            There are a few things in life so beautiful they hurt: swimming in
            the ocean while it rains, reading alone in empty libraries, the sea
            of stars that appear when you’re miles away from the neon lights of
            the city, bars after 2am, walking in the wilderness, all the phases
            of the moon, the things we do not know about the universe, and you.
            -Beau Taplin

        <h2>Here’s a poem I wrote:</h2>
        <pre>
  In the grasp of a cloud
  there's always sky
  when its blue, when its dark.
  Underneath the moon
  a television Keeps on playing
  a static noise,
  because too much noise is
  always static.
  too many colors, black.
  too much fondness, blue.
  But still i know, you think of me
  exactly the way i think about you.
  It reflects.
  I have time, for you.
