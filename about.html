          Dear Heaven-sent, <br />
          This heart beats at the sound of your breath. The moon, the stars and,
          every other totally normal things poets have associated love with, I
          associate with you. Speaking of “normal”, I don’t feel it when I’m
          away from you. And I believe that I’m not the only one who feels this
          way. And if I’m right, we both know that locking eyes with each other
          and talking about nothing and everything would always help. You’re
          beautiful. The eclipse in the lower right side of your bottom lip
          alone can make a man lose his sleep for a year. The brownish dark glow
          in your eyes have always looked like winter forest in my eyes. Your
          hair speaks to me, if that makes sense. Your nose looks like a human
          nose. Happy birthday. I love you a lot, Iru. <br />
          Sincerely, <br />Musicman
